# Perpetuality
Genre: Psychological Horror, Puzzle

## Game Summary
In Perpetuality, players navigate a surreal and unsettling labyrinth within a mysterious university building, representing the fractured psyche of a computer science student. Each level or phase is a different dream or psychological state, mirroring the student's academic pressures, fears, and emotional turmoil. To escape this labyrinth, players must interact with various NPCs, including faculty members, fellow students, and the school mascot. The journey is both a literal and metaphorical exploration of internal struggles, focusing on maintaining sanity amidst an ever-shifting, nightmarish environment.

## Narrative Overview
You play as an unnamed computer science student trapped within the labyrinthine corridors of a university that distorts and manifests their mental state. Each dream phase evokes different aspects of academic life and psychological stress, creating a unique and eerie setting with every progression. The goal is to escape by solving puzzles, interacting with characters, and managing sanityâ€”all while avoiding the malevolent presence of the school mascot, who embodies the student's deepest fears.

## Story Elements
- Protagonist: An unnamed computer science student struggling with the stress and pressures of university life. Their experiences within the labyrinth reflect their internal conflicts and emotional struggles.
- Antagonist: The university's school mascot represents the student's fears and insecurities. It acts as both a guide and a threat, manipulating the labyrinth and the student's perceptions.
- Setting: A university campus that transforms into a surreal and disorienting labyrinth. Familiar locations become distorted, representing the protagonist's mental state.
- Objective: Escape the labyrinth by navigating through various dream phases, interacting with NPCs, solving puzzles, and managing the protagonist's sanity.

## Inspiration
Perpetuality draws inspiration from psychological horror games that emphasize atmosphere, sanity management, and surreal environments:
- Amnesia: The Dark Descent: Influenced our sanity mechanics and atmospheric tension, focusing on maintaining sanity through environmental interactions and evasion rather than combat.
- Shinkansen 0, Exit 8, Platform 8: Inspired our sense of disorientation and anomaly detection mechanics, utilizing repetitive and unsettling environments with the concept of resets upon failure.
- Rusty Lake: Roots: Contributed to our game's eerie atmosphere and dark narrative style, incorporating disturbing imagery and surreal puzzles.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Sanity Management
- Increasing Sanity: Interact with objects that trigger calming memories, such as notes, photos, or music. Successfully figuring out the puzzle also increases sanity.
- Decreasing Sanity: First, student is not in a safe room (the current saferoom is the bathroom). Second, if student interacts with objects in an incorrect way (or with an incorrect object). Third, if student encounters the monster.

### Progression
- Navigate through multiple dream phases, each representing different psychological states. Different dream phases likely correspond to different scenes.
- Each phase may have unique mechanics affecting the player's sanity level.

### Special Events and Triggers
- Certain events or objects may trigger the appearance of a monster, adding urgency to maintain sanity.
- Lower sanity increases the frequency of these threats (potentially).

### User Interface and Controls
- Sanity Bar: Displayed on-screen, updating in real-time based on player actions and in-game events.
- Interactions: Use standard controls to interact with the environment, items, and NPCs.
- Exploration: Objectives are discovered through exploration and interaction rather than explicit instructions.

**As development progresses, additional mechanics and story elements will be introduced to enhance gameplay depth and narrative cohesion.**

## Development (Submission 2 Progress)
 ### User Input
    - Maps out the controls of the game
        - WASD: move
        - Left click: interact
        - Right click: inspect
 ### Game Manager
    - Renders the scenes we would want to display in our game
        - Bathroom (Reset, Rest point) 
            - A possible save point for the user to stay in
            - A custom asset that has a light source in the scene
    - Loads in cubes that would soon be interactable objects which would increase or decrease sanity
 ### Objects
    - Interactable cubes
        - Red and Green: collectable
            - They will disappear once you collect them
        - Yellow and Pink:
            - Change color or shape
 ### Scene Loader
    - Loads a scene in the game
 ### Game State
    - Keep track of the sanity bar
    - Will keep track if the game is over or not
        - Game will be over when sanity reaches 0
            - So far it would only print game over in the console, need to work on making a game over state
        - 1st iteration: sanity bar implemented, but UI is not implemented yet
 ### Game Control
    - Press using cursor to examine interactable object, selected object will rotate.
    - Clicks on object to interact (object turns gray once interacted), this action 
     will affect sanity value based on the type of object.
    - Green Box as an example of collectable object: disappears upon click 
     (collection)
### Inventory System
    - Inventory that is used to maintain sanity by consuming items
 ### Ways to increase sanity
    - Interacting with objects
        - 1st iteration: interacting with good boxes
    - Standing on a light source
        - 1st iteration: light source implemented, but the sanity bar increasing not implemented
    - Consuming item in the inventory system
 ### Ways to decrease sanity
    - Interacting with objects
        - 1st iteration: interacting with bad boxes
    - Standing in darkness
        - 1st iteration: user will lose sanity by default for now

## Development (Submission 3 Progress)
 ### Dialog Box
    - Informs the user of what event has occur
        - Triggered by consuming an item in the inventory system (working in progress)
        - Triggered by an event system
        ![Alt text for image](./Images/DialogExample.png)
 ### Safe Areas
    - Player can now increase their sanity by going into certain safe areas like the Bathroom
    - Bathroom and other safe areas have triggerbox that cause sanity to increase
 ### Event System
    - An observer class that handles event that occurs in game
    - For now informs the player of their respawn status
    - If an event triggers, a functionality will fire off
        - If the event respawn occurs, the player will respawn in the bathroom
    - This event system will make it easier to add more functionality to our game
        - Easily adding new custom events by adding more functionailty in the function triggerEvents
        - Can easily be used with the Inventory System (working in progress)
 ### Puzzles
    - We are not sure about what type of puzzles we want to implement, so we are deciding to make mechanics that will help us make these puzzles
    - The next few items in the deliverable will mention some details about these game mechanics
 ### Inventory System
    - Now has two types of items
        - Key items
            - An item that can possibly be used for puzzles later in our development
            - If a player consume this item, an event will trigger
        - Consumables 
            - Mostly used to increase or decrease sanity
 ### Flashlight
    - User has a spotlight attached to the camera
