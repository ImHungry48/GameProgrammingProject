# Perpetuality
Genre: Psychological Horror, Puzzle

## Game Summary
In Perpetuality, players navigate a surreal and unsettling labyrinth within a mysterious university building, representing the fractured psyche of a computer science student. Each level or phase is a different dream or psychological state, mirroring the student's academic pressures, fears, and emotional turmoil. To escape this labyrinth, players must interact with various NPCs, including faculty members, fellow students, and the school mascot. The journey is both a literal and metaphorical exploration of internal struggles, focusing on maintaining sanity amidst an ever-shifting, nightmarish environment.

## Narrative Overview
You play as an unnamed computer science student trapped within the labyrinthine corridors of a university that distorts and manifests their mental state. Each dream phase evokes different aspects of academic life and psychological stress, creating a unique and eerie setting with every progression. The goal is to escape by solving puzzles, interacting with characters, and managing sanityâ€”all while avoiding the malevolent presence of the school mascot, who embodies the student's deepest fears.

## Story Elements
- Protagonist: An unnamed computer science student struggling with the stress and pressures of university life. Their experiences within the labyrinth reflect their internal conflicts and emotional struggles.
- Antagonist: The university's school mascot represents the student's fears and insecurities. It acts as both a guide and a threat, manipulating the labyrinth and the student's perceptions.
- Setting: A university campus that transforms into a surreal and disorienting labyrinth. Familiar locations become distorted, representing the protagonist's mental state.
- Objective: Escape the labyrinth by navigating through various dream phases, interacting with NPCs, solving puzzles, and managing the protagonist's sanity.

## Inspiration
Perpetuality draws inspiration from psychological horror games that emphasize atmosphere, sanity management, and surreal environments:
- Amnesia: The Dark Descent: Influenced our sanity mechanics and atmospheric tension, focusing on maintaining sanity through environmental interactions and evasion rather than combat.
- Shinkansen 0, Exit 8, Platform 8: Inspired our sense of disorientation and anomaly detection mechanics, utilizing repetitive and unsettling environments with the concept of resets upon failure.
- Rusty Lake: Roots: Contributed to our game's eerie atmosphere and dark narrative style, incorporating disturbing imagery and surreal puzzles.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Sanity Management
- Increasing Sanity: Interact with objects that trigger calming memories, such as notes, photos, or music.
- Decreasing Sanity: Encounter stressors common to computer science students, like challenging puzzles and difficult exams, which lower the sanity bar.

### Progression
- Navigate through multiple dream phases, each representing different psychological states.
- Each phase may have unique mechanics affecting the player's sanity level.

### Special Events and Triggers
- Certain events or objects may trigger the appearance of a monster, adding urgency to maintain sanity.
- Lower sanity increases the frequency of these threats.

### User Interface and Controls
- Sanity Bar: Displayed on-screen, updating in real-time based on player actions and in-game events.
- Interactions: Use standard controls to interact with the environment, items, and NPCs.
- Exploration: Objectives are discovered through exploration and interaction rather than explicit instructions.

**As development progresses, additional mechanics and story elements will be introduced to enhance gameplay depth and narrative cohesion.**
